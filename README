NAME
    "String::Tagged::HTML" - format HTML output using "String::Tagged"

SYNOPSIS
     use String::Tagged::HTML;

     my $st = String::Tagged::HTML->new( "An important message" );

     $st->apply_tag( 3, 9, b => 1 );

     print $st->as_html( "h1" );

DESCRIPTION
    This subclass of String::Tagged provides a method, "as_html", for
    rendering the string as an HTML fragment, using the tags to provide
    formatting. For example, the SYNOPSIS example will produce the output

     <h1>An <b>important</b> message</h1>

    With the exception of tags named "raw", a tag applied to an extent of
    the "String::Tagged::HTML" will be rendered using start and end HTML
    tags of the same name. If the tag's value is a "HASH" reference, then
    this hash will be used to provide additional attributes for the HTML
    element.

     my $str = String::Tagged::HTML->new( "click here" );
     $str->apply_tag( 6, 4, a => { href => "/see/other.html" } );

     print $str->as_html( "p" );



     <p>click <a href="/see/other.html">here</a></p>

    If it is not a "HASH" reference, then its value ought to be a simple
    boolean true value, such as 1.

    The special tag named "raw" disables HTML entity escaping over its
    extent.

     my $str = String::Tagged::HTML->new( "This <content> is escaped" );

     my $br = String::Tagged::HTML->new( "<br/>" );
     $br->apply_tag( 0, $br->length, raw => 1 );

     print +( $str . $br )->as_html( "p" );



     <p>This &lt;content&gt; is escaped<br/></p>

  Tag Nesting
    Because of the arbitrary way that "String::Tagged" tags may be applied,
    as compared to the strict nesting requirements in HTML, the "as_html"
    method may have to break a single "String::Tagged" tag into multiple
    regions. In the following example, the "i" tag has been split in two to
    allow it to overlap correctly with "b".

     my $str = String::Tagged::HTML->new( "bbb b+i iii" );
     $str->apply_tag( 0, 7, b => 1 );
     $str->apply_tag( 4, 7, i => 1 );

     print $str->as_html



     <b>bbb <i>b+i</i></b><i> iii</i>

CONSTRUCTORS
    As well as the standard "new" and "new_tagged" constructors provided by
    String::Tagged, the following is provided.

  $st = String::Tagged::HTML->new_raw( $str )
    Returns a new "String::Tagged::HTML" instance with the "raw" tag applied
    over its entire length. This convenience is provided for creating
    objects containing already-rendered HTML fragments.

METHODS
    The following methods are provided in addition to those provided by
    String::Tagged.

  $html = $st->as_html( $element )
    Returns a string containing an HTML rendering of the current contents of
    the object. If $element is provided, the output will be wrapped in an
    element of the given name. If not defined, no outer wrapping will be
    performed.
